<p>Decomposition makes responsibilities explcit</p>
<p>Recompose to make relationsships explcit</p>

<p>Naming things is hard, because you first need to identify the right parts to name</p>
<p>Combinators give us a language for naming things</p>

<p>Deconstructing functions in smaller parts and putting them together</p>

<p>Aim #1: Decompose responsibilities</p>
<p>Aim #2: Name the parts that are important to us</p>
<p>Aim #3: Extract the parts we want to use more than once</p>
<p>E.g.: `const pluckWith = compose(mapWith, getWith);`</p>
<p>Parts are named (mapWith, and getWith)</p>
<p>Relationship between them is named (pluckWith)</p>
<p>Quote: <em>We compose entities to make the relationships between them explicit</em></p>
<p>In current software there is an over-emphasis on nouns, and under-emphasis und things that are verbs</p>
